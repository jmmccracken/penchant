Causal penchant and leaning
===

These MATLAB scripts calculate the causal penchant and causal leaning introduced in [1].  Running the script _SimpleIRexample_ will produce a array of leanings similar to the ones used to produce Figure 1 of [1].  The scripts use the following internal MATLAB functions: _nan_, _zeros_, _length_, _mean_, _fprintf_, _tic_, _toc_, and _randn_.  It has not been tested on any open source MATLAB equivalents such as Octave or Scilab.

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 with kernel version 3.13.0-68-generic x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux with Matlab 7.9.1.671 (R2009b) Service Pack 1 64-bit (glnxa64).
